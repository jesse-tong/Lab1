\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RSA Encryption:} Used to encrypt the symmetric AES key.
    \item \textbf{AES Encryption:} Used for the encryption of the actual file data.
    \item \textbf{Hashing using SHA-256:} Applied to ensure data integrity by checking the hash of the encrypted file against that of the decrypted file. 


\section{Special Parameters}
The following parameters are notable in the encryption settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RSA Key Size:} A standard of 2048 bits is used for generating RSA key pairs, providing a good balance between security and performance.
    \item \textbf{AES Key Size:} An AES block size of 16 bytes (128 bits) is utilized for encrypting the data.
    \item \textbf{Hash Algorithm:} The SHA-256 hash function is employed to verify the integrity of the encrypted data.
    \item \textbf{Supported File Types:} The system is designed to handle various binary files for encryption and decryption, with no explicit limitations on file types within the binary format.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The hybrid encryption system effectively combines the benefits of RSA and AES to ensure secure communication, data confidentiality, and integrity.
